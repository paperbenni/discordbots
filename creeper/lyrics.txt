Creeper
Aw man
So we back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side
Side side to side
This task a grueling one
Hope to find some diamonds tonight night night
Diamonds tonight
Heads up
You hear a sound turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh no its you again
I can never forget those eyes eyes eyes
Eyes eye eyes
Cause baby tonight
The creepers tryna steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again 
And run run until its done done
Until the sun comes up in the morn
Cause baby tonight
The creepers tryna steal all our stuff again 
Just when you think youre safe
Overhear some hissing from right behind
Right right behind
Thats a nice life you have
Shame its gotta end at this time time time
Time time time time
Blows up
Then your health bar drops and you could use a one up
Get inside dont be tardy
So now youre stuck in there
Half a heart is left but dont die die die
Die die die
Cause baby tonight
The creepers tryna steal all our stuff again
Cause baby tonight
You grab your pick shovel and bolt again 
And run run until its done done
Until the sun comes up in the morn
Cause baby tonight
The creepers tryna steal all our stuff again
Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
And make some armor get it baby

The creepers tryna steal all our stuff again
